# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

  For our project, we plan to use Java to create a space invaders type video game.  Initially the plan will be to make the game very basic, where a ship fires at asteroids or enemies using a single lazer and points are awarded for connecting shots.  Depending on the difficulty level of creating a the base level with just asteroids and a single lazer, the game will be expanded to match a difficulty level appropriate for the class.  Upgrades, new enemies, and increasing level difficulties can be added in order to increase game complexity.  Boss levels will also be considered depending on if the scope of the project seems to be to simple. 
  
  None of us have created a game of this sort before, so before beginning the project we will be watching how-to videos to get acclimated with designing such a project. Depending on each of our strengths, level design, writing code, and game concepts will be designated to group members during our weekly meetings.  We will also be using stack-overflow, and plan on meeting with members of the CISLAB if difficulties ensue.  
  
 

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)
The only technology that we presume we will be using is a computer with Intelli-J. Once more research has been done on the project, it is possible that other software may need to be aquired to assist in the creation of the game. 

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)
We will begin by looking up video's and tutorials for basic games individually and collaborating with the information we have each aquired.  We will then begin our weekly meetings to assign rolls to each individual for the week.

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)
Milstones:
1. Create a single dot(ship) on a blank map
2. Make that ship fire another dot(lazer)
3. Make a dot(asteroid) drop from the top of the screen directly above the ship
4. Make the fired lazer connect with the asteroid, destroying it and awarding points
5. Make the asteroids fall in different places and directions. 
6. Create movement for the ship.
7. Change the dots to images(ship, lazer, asteroid).
8. Create enemies that move in different patterns than the asteroids, with different potential attacks
9. Create ranomly generated drops from the asteroids containing different lazer or movement upgrades.
10. Create boss fights if time permits.

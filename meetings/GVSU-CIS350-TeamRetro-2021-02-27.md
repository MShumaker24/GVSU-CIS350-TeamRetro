Discussion points: 

* We need to look through some things online in order to get an idea on how we will make the game.
* There are many resources available to look through, we just need time to do some reasearch on each of them.

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Each person will look through at least one of the links provided in the feedback to our project proposal. 
* We will familiarize ourselves with these libraries in order to decide which one will work best for our project.
* We are planning on meeting again on Tuesday to decide which library to use and to start getting a foundation ready for the game.
